        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 cups of chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 lb of portobello mushroom</li>
                        <li>1 lb of white mushroom</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of Arborio rice</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of dry white wine</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of finely chopped chives</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside. </li>
                <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes. </li>
                <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
                <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions. </li>

                <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
                <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. </li>
                <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
